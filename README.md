# Projects: SQL
Database: Udacity Parch and Posey Database

In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):

web_events
accounts
orders
sales_reps
region

You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name. For example, the region table has two columns: id and name. Alternatively the web_events table has four columns.
